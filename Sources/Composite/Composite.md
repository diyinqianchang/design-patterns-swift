# Composite

### Description </br>
The Composite pattern describes that a group of objects is to be treated in the same way as a single instance of an object.
The intent of a composite is to "compose" objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
Implementing the Composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.  At the heart of this pattern is the ability for a client to perform operations on an object without needing to know that there are many objects inside. </br>

### iOS/MacOS adaptation </br>
The most important use seen is UIView class.  UIView defines the common behavior for all the elements in an app layout. </br>
Individual views in the view hierarchy can be left nodes (like UILabels) or composite objects containing collections of other UIViews or UIView subclasses. </br>
